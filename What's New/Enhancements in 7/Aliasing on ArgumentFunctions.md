You can now set an alias name on an ArgumentFunction

Such as Day, Count, …

Earlier, you could say Count(fieldInfo) with an alias on the fieldInfo

Now you can set the alias on the function itself, making it possible to use the same fieldInfo in multiple functions – such as dateparts

You can then retrieve values by alias name, instead of ordinal number
