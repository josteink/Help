The SuperOffice Client Database Library is a client-side Application Programming Interface (API) COM object. Most of the data in the SuperOffice database is available through this API without having to log into the SuperOffice CRM Windows client application. In order to use the COM API in a .net project, the project first needs a reference to the SuperOfficeDB.Interop.dll or the SuperOfficeDB.dll. The interop assemblies are by default installed in the C:\\Program Files\\SuperOffice\\Expander SDK directory. If you changed the path during the Expander Toolkit installation, the interop assemblies reside in the choosen installation directory.
