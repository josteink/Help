NetServer data objects consist of Rows, Entities and Entity Collections. Entities contain properties that are basic data types, such as: String, Double, Int, etc. Additionally Entity contain properties that are also complex types, such as other Entity types, Entity Collections, as well as Row and Rows types. Every Entity type has a relative Entity Collection. In order to use NetServer Data objects in a .net project, references to SoCore.dll and the SoDatabase.dll are required. Additionally, every NetServer application requires a configuration file that contains all the settings necessary for NetServer to run properly.
