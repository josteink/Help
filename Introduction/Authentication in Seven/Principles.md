Authentication and authorization are crucial, and separate, concepts

Authentication is about identity â€“ who you are

We can **delegate** the identification of the user to anyone we trust to do so

How we know who the user is, does not matter (unless we had different levels of trust, like the Norwegian tax website does)

Authorization is about what you can do, once we know who you are

We cannot delegate authorization; that is our own domain

 

The importance of keeping authentication, identity and authorization clearly apart in your mind cannot be over-emphasized. Mix them up and bad things will happen, such as unpleasant dependencies creeping into your system.

One important characteristic of the new system is that it tries to separate these concepts completely.

* Authentication is a process that resolves credentials (evidence) into an identity, and nothing else

* Identity defines who you are, and nothing else

* Authorization derives from identity, and defines what you can do, whoever you are
