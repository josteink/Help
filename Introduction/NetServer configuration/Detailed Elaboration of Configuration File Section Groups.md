A NetServer application configuration file makes use of a .net [configSections](http://devnet.superoffice.com/templates/(EmptyReference!)) element to categorize different configuration category groups within a single SuperOffice [sectionGroup](http://devnet.superoffice.com/templates/(EmptyReference!)) element.

Under the SuperOffice sectionGroup, there are additional sectionGroups that encapsulate section definitions that define section-specific NetServer settings. For example, there is a Security sectionGroup that delineates a Cryptography section.
