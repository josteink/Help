This key relates to the mode that you can define for the NetServer to retrieve information from the application. The default mode type can be defined as either Local, Remote or Switch. For example, should you define the default mode as Local the NetServer initially tries to retrieve information from this mode. 

```
<add key="DefaultMode" value="Local" />
<add key="DefaultMode" value="Remote" />
```
