Having calendar data in SuperOffice is nice, but there are lots of other places that your calendar shows up. Your phone has a calendar, and while SO Pocket is nice, it may not be available on your type of phone, or you may want to display the calendar on your desktop using a calendar widget.

The iCal standard is a way to publish calendar data on the internet. This standard lets us publish your calendar in a way that lets Apple, Google and others read your appointments.

We will build a simple web site that lets you log in to SuperOffice and get a unique URL that you can use to read your calendar without logging in each time. This unique URL should not be easy to guess, so that others canâ€™t access your calendar without your permission.
