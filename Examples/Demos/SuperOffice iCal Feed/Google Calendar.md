So if you have a Google Phone, you can now get your SuperOffice calendar to show up on the phone. To do this we go via the Google Calendar web page.

First we log in to the <http://calendar.google.com/> web site.

Click on the ADD menu under OTHER CALENDARS: ADD BY URL

A simple dialog box appears (similar to the one in Outlook)

You paste the ical.aspx?associd=123&guid=1234-4567â€¦  link in here.

Google will read the appointments and layer them on top of your calendar.  You can change the name and whether the calendar is shared by editing the settings.

The resulting calendar looks like this:

These appointments will now also appear on you Android phone calendar if you have enabled calendar sync on your device.
