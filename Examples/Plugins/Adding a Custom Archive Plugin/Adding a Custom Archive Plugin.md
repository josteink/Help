In this section, we will walk you through an example of adding a Custom Archive. The example is based on the Tooltip Provider.

A tooltip is a common graphical user interface element used in conjunction with a cursor, usually a mouse pointer. The user hovers the cursor over an item without clicking it, a small box appears with the name, and description of the item hovered over. These tooltips are nice especially when they show a lot of information. The problem is that such tooltips are expensive and we cannot pre-calculate all the tooltips the user might see.
