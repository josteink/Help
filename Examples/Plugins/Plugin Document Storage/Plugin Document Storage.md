Plugins are created using a Factory class. When creating a Document Plugin we make use of the DocumentPluginBase class, which is located in the SuperOffice.CRM.Documents namespace.

Document plugins are responsible for two things: putting documents into something, and getting documents out of something.

These plugins are simpler than the windows clientâ€™s document plugins, since they have no user interface or extra features (like versioning, custom commands, custom document dialog). These features will be added in a later release.

This document plugin is a low-level API aimed at getting documents in and out of a document store.
