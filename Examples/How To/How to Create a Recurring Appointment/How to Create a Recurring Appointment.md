The intention of this document is to demonstrate the use of AppointmentMatrix to create recurring appointments. SuperOffice.CRM.Entities.AppointmentMatrix is a matrix holding information about repeating appointment and its participants.

In the following example, we will be creating an appointment at 2.00 P.M. tomorrow which will recur for the next 8 working days.

The following screenshot shows the resulting recurring appointment in the SuperOffice diary week-view.
