All pictures are stored in the BinaryObject table in the database. This document describes how we can retrieve such information using SoCore and SoDatabase dlls.

What we have done in the example below is that we have displayed the Image description in ListBox and based on the selection made by the user we would retrieve and display that image in a PictureBox.

Below image shows the result of the example.
