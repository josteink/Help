Archives are lists with multiple columns. You can specify restrictions and which columns you want from an archive provider. The archive provider will then take care of constructing the joins, filtering out private information, and generally making life easier.
The contact's person archive is a PersonArchive with a restriction on a contact\_id = X.

A person search result is easily implemented as a PersonArchive with a more complex set of restrictions.
