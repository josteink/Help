OSQL, which stands for Objectified SQL, is the SuperOffice Database Interface or the SODBIF. This layer is the closest to the database in the NetServer Architecture and any calls that are made through the higher layers of the architecture would go through this layer. Therefore, anything that can be done through the Service, RDB and HDB layer can also be done through this layer. This sections aims to show how you could achieve the same results achived through the higher layer of NetServer.
