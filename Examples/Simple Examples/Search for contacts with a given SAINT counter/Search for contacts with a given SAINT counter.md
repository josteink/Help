SAINT counters are used to keep track of certain actions and SAINT requires a separate license. Countervalue table maintains SAINT counters. When SAINT is enabled, whenever a contact or project is created a set of rows are added to the countervalue table. There is always a row in the countervalue table corresponding to appointment, document or sale. The respective counter rows in the countervalue table will be updated whenever an appointment, document or sale is created. In this section we will explain how to search for contacts with a given SAINT value set.
