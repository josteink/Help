Now letâ€™s look at the last method which OSQL.

```
using SuperOffice.CRM.Security;
using SuperOffice.CRM.Data;
using SuperOffice.Data;
using SuperOffice.Data.SQL;
using SuperOffice;
 
using(SoSession session = SoSession.Authenticate("SAL0", ""))
{
//get a connection to connect to the DB.
      SoConnection myConn = ConnectionFactory.GetConnection();
 
      //Creating a SoCommand instance
      SoCommand myComm = myConn.CreateCommand();
      //open the connection
      myConn.Open();
 
      //Creating DataSets with the Tables of the Database
      SelectionMemberTableInfo selectionMemTableInfo =
      TablesInfo.GetSelectionMemberTableInfo();
               
      //Creating an instance of the Insert class
      Insert newInsert = S.NewInsert();
 
      //lets add two member to the static selection we choose
      //add the first member
               
     
newInsert.FieldValuePairs.Add(selectionMemTableInfo.SelectionmemberId
      , S.Parameter(Sequence.GetNext(selectionMemTableInfo)));
     
     
newInsert.FieldValuePairs.Add(selectionMemTableInfo.SelectionId,
      S.Parameter(65));
               
     
newInsert.FieldValuePairs.Add(selectionMemTableInfo.ContactId,
      S.Parameter(21));
               
      newInsert.FieldValuePairs.Add(selectionMemTableInfo.PersonId,
      S.Parameter(55));
      //Begin Transaction
      SoTransaction newTrans = myConn.BeginTransaction();
      myComm.Transaction = newTrans;
 
      //Executing the Insert Statement
      myComm.SqlCommand = newInsert;
      myComm.ExecuteNonQuery();
 
      //Committing the transaction and clossing the session
      newTrans.Commit();
      myConn.Close();
}
```

 

We are adding two members to a static selection that we choose. At this level of the NetServer you need to have a very good understanding of the SuperOffice database so you create the correct table info objects to insert or update the database table. In this example we are only adding members to a static selection so we have created a SelectionMemberTableInfo object since we know that the data gets inserted to the SelectionMember table. If you analyze the above code carefully you can observe that we have used a class called Sequence to get the next sequence of the SelectionMember table. This class will help you to get the next sequence number of any table if you provide the correct table info.

In then above example you may have noticed that we have only added one member to the static selection. If we want to add more than one member we cannot do it with only the above mechanisms you will have to use some other ways to do it.

```
using SuperOffice.CRM.Data;
using SuperOffice.Data;
using SuperOffice.Data.SQL;
using SuperOffice;
 
using(SoSession session = SoSession.Authenticate("SAL0", ""))
{
//get a connection to connect to the DB.
      SoConnection myConn = ConnectionFactory.GetConnection();
 
      //Creating a SoCommand instance
      SoCommand myComm = myConn.CreateCommand();
      //open the connection
      myConn.Open();
 
      //Creating DataSets with the Tables of the Database
      SelectionMemberTableInfo selectionMemTableInfo =
      TablesInfo.GetSelectionMemberTableInfo();
 
      //Creating an instance of the Insert class
      Insert newInsert = S.NewInsert();
      Insert secondInsert = S.NewInsert();
 
      //lets add two member to the static selection we choose
      //add the first member
               
     
newInsert.FieldValuePairs.Add(selectionMemTableInfo.SelectionmemberId
      , S.Parameter(Sequence.GetNext(selectionMemTableInfo)));
               
     
newInsert.FieldValuePairs.Add(selectionMemTableInfo.SelectionId,
      S.Parameter(65));
               
     
newInsert.FieldValuePairs.Add(selectionMemTableInfo.ContactId,
      S.Parameter(21));
                
      newInsert.FieldValuePairs.Add(selectionMemTableInfo.PersonId,
      S.Parameter(55));
      //add the second member
               
     
secondInsert.FieldValuePairs.Add(selectionMemTableInfo.Selectionmembe
      rId, S.Parameter(Sequence.GetNext(selectionMemTableInfo)));
               
     
secondInsert.FieldValuePairs.Add(selectionMemTableInfo.SelectionId,
      S.Parameter(65));
               
     
secondInsert.FieldValuePairs.Add(selectionMemTableInfo.ContactId,  
   S.Parameter(21));
               
     
secondInsert.FieldValuePairs.Add(selectionMemTableInfo.PersonId,
      S.Parameter(56));
 
      //create a batch save object
      BatchSave myBatchSave = new BatchSave();
      //add the insert statements to the created batch save object
      myBatchSave.Add(newInsert);
      myBatchSave.Add(secondInsert); 
 
      //Begin Transaction
      SoTransaction newTrans = myConn.BeginTransaction();
      myComm.Transaction = newTrans;
 
      //assign the batch save object as teh SQL command
      myComm.SqlCommand = myBatchSave;
      //Executing the batch save
      myComm.ExecuteNonQuery();
 
      //Committing the transaction and clossing the session
      newTrans.Commit();
      myConn.Close();           
}
```

 

If you analyze this example you can observe that we have made two additional changes. We have created a new insert object and added the second member through that and we have created a new object call the batch save. This new batch save object holds the secret to adding more than one member to a static selection. A batch save object can hold many SQL statements for us; it acts as an array of SQL statements. In this case it holds two insert statements for us. So when we add our SQL statements to the batch save object and then we assign the batch save object as our SQL command in the SO command object. Now when we execute our query the NetServer will do the rest for us. It will add the two records to the SelectionMember table with the correct selection member id.

An important point to remember!

If you are adding members to a static selection by hard coding the contact id and the person id, or if you are getting these values from a user interface input, you must make sure that the person id belongs to a person that belongs to the contact id you are specifying for a given SelectionMemberRow.
