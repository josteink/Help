The link to an AD identity is based on the SID, not the name

AD user name changes have no effect – everything still works

SuperOffice user name can be renamed, and we’ll try to rename so\_arc for you. Do this if you need to, not for fun

In most cases, superoffice name = AD name is the way to go. But sometimes that does not fit...

The little \[...\] button can be used to change authentication method. You can link up an existing user to AD, and vice versa. This does not change anything about the associate, only the authentication method

Columns in the user list can be set to show authentication type

Changing authentication method is like changing your socks – it may get you into your Club or not, but it doesn’t really change **who you are** inside of SuperOffice. Remember that a superoffice identity is an associate, and those are not affected by authentication changes. Only **how you convince the system you are that associate** changes. So you can play with this safely, as much as you want.
