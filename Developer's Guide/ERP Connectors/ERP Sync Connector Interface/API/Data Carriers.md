[Data carriers]()
==============================

Data carriers (or just “carriers”) are object types that transfer data between Erp Sync/SO and the Sync Connector. These objects have no methods or behaviour; they are pure data transfer objects (DTO).

 

* [Field Meta-data carrier](Field%20Meta%20Data%20Carrier.md) describes configuration settings for the connection.
* [ERP Actor data carrier](ERP%20Actor%20Carrier.md) describes company/person/project data.
