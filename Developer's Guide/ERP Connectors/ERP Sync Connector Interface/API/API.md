[]() [ConnectorHost]()
-----------------------------------

SuperOffice offers an [IIS web service site](../Architecture/ERP%20Sync%20Service%20WCF%20Host.md) which is designed to simplify the process of developing and deploying a Sync Connector. The connector host will be able to host any number of named connectors, and will be able to expose their methods through web service calls.
