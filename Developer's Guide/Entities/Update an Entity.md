In order to update an Entity we must retrieve it by using the Idx class. When an Entity is retrieved using the Idx class, the data is retrieved and kept in memory and what ever manipulation to the data we make is made to this cached data. After the execution of the Save() method only the data will be updated in the database accordingly. This section explains how we can retrieve and update an Entity and its properties.
