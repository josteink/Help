Those who have previously worked with T-SQL, Stored Procedures and Those who do not find it intimidating to get close to the database, would enjoy using OSQL rather than using Service, Row and Entities. However there are many things to consider, and be aware of, when you are getting closer to the core since thereâ€™s a whole number of different ways that you may be trapped or buried when creating your own inserts, updates and deletes outside of the business objects within the NetServer. The advantage is that when using the OSQL to create code the code would be more responsive and efficient than when using the Services, RDB or the HDB layers.
